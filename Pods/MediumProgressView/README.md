The easiest way to get started is to use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/). Add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!
# The following is a Library of Swift.
pod 'MediumProgressView'
```

Then, run the following command:

```ruby
pod install
```

###Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that automates the process of adding frameworks to your Cocoa application.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate MediumProgressView into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl

```

Run `carthage update`.

```bash
$ carthage update
```
###Other

Add the MediumProgressView (including MediumProgressView.swift and  MediumProgressViewManager.swift) folder into your project.

You can set the certain property. For example, position and color, height, duration and so on. If you don't set the these property, default value is used.

```Swift
let mediumProgressViewManager = MediumProgressViewManager.sharedInstance
mediumProgressViewManager.position      = .Top         // Default is top.
mediumProgressViewManager.color         = MEDIUM_COLOR // Default is UIColor(red:0.33, green:0.83, blue:0.44, alpha:1).
mediumProgressViewManager.height        = 4.0          // Default is 4.0.
mediumProgressViewManager.isLeftToRight = true         // Default is true.
mediumProgressViewManager.duration      = 1.0          // Default is 1.2.
